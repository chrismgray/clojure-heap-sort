* Heap sort

  This is an implementation of the =heap-sort= algorithm in pure
  Clojure.  As opposed to the standard =sort= algorithm in Clojure
  (which is inherited from Java), it returns a lazy sequence of sorted
  elements.  Thus, it should be theoretically faster than =sort= if
  only a small number of elements from the start of the sorted
  sequence are used.

  Tests are given showing that this is the case for large inputs.
  They also show that it is not much slower than =sort= for large
  inputs.

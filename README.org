* Heap sort

  This is an implementation of the =heap-sort= algorithm in pure
  Clojure.  As opposed to the standard =sort= algorithm in Clojure, it
  returns a lazy sequence of sorted elements.  Thus, it should be
  theoretically faster than the standard =sort= algorithm in Clojure
  if only a small number of elements from the start of the sorted
  sequence are used.

  As it is implemented (using Clojure vectors), it is not currently
  faster than Clojure =sort=, even when using only the first element
  of the sorted list.
